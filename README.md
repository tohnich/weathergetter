#### Technology Used
- HTML / CSS / SASS
- Javascript / JQuery
- simpleWeather API (utilized to get weather data)

#### Resources Utilized
- [Coverr.co](http://www.coverr.co) - Looped background videos
- [Erik Flowers Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) - Weather condition icons

#### Reason for Building
WeatherGetter was a personal project to gain more experience and practice working with Flexbox, SASS, responsive design, and Javascript / JQuery.
I utilized heavy usage of opacity to allow the background video / image to set the overall mood of the page, which changes based off the current condition's outside the location entered.
Heavy documentation through comments was used throughout this project.
